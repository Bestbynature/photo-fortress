## Introduction

The Photo Fortress API allows users to upload images securely and retrieve them using a secure URL format. It's designed to provide a simple and efficient way to manage images in applications.

## Authentication

The Photo Fortress API does not require authentication for basic functionality. However, certain endpoints or features may require authentication in future versions.
